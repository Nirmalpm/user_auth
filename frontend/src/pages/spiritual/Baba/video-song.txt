Every morning when the sun 10-19
comes out to play 17-20
It wears the same bright orange dress 21 - 26
our swami wears today 26-30
its the color of Sathya sai 32 - 37
the color of love 39-41
he is love he is love he is everything every where 42-52
we all love and that is 
what creation made up of
Sathya sai Sathya sai Sathya sai Babaji
Sathya sai Sathya sai Sathya sai Babaji
Oh Shirdi sai Sathya sai prema sai Babaji
oh Sathya sai you and I Sathya sai Babaji

And every evening when the sun goes down 
in its same bright orange dress
I feel the touch of Sathya sai 
his love his tenderness
as he enters the temple of my loving heart
he is love he is love he is everything every where 42-52
we all love and that is 
what creation is made up of
Sathya sai Sathya sai Sathya sai Babaji
Oh Shirdi sai Sathya sai prema sai Babaji
Sathya sai Sathya sai Sathya sai Babaji
oh Sathya sai you and I Sathya sai Babaji
